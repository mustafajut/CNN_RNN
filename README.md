Implement a simple feedforward neural network and backpropagation network Optimize and train the neural network with various techniques. discuss it is overfit and underfit. Implement a CNN and RNN for a specific task and perform Fine-tune and optimize CNN and RNN using advanced techniques. **

# Part 1: Implementing a Simple Feedforward Neural Network  
We'll use TensorFlow/Keras for this implementation. Let's create a basic feedforward neural network for a classification task.

# Part 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with MNIST Data

**Overfitting and Underfitting Overfitting:** Occurs when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen test data. This can be addressed by regularization techniques like dropout, weight regularization, or data augmentation.

**Underfitting**: Happens when the model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns of the data. This can be improved by increasing the model complexity, such as adding more layers or neurons.

# Part 3: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with MNIST Data For RNNs 
we use the MNIST data as sequences. We will reshape the data to fit the RNN input requirements.

**Fine-Tuning and Optimizing RNN LSTM/GRU:** Use more advanced RNN cells like LSTM or GRU to capture long-term dependencies. 
**Bidirectional RNN**: Process data in both forward and backward directions. 
**Dropout:** Apply dropout to RNN layers to prevent overfitting. Advanced Techniques for RNN


## Summary
**Feedforward Neural Network (FNN):** Best for simple tasks; monitor for overfitting and underfitting by comparing training and validation performance.

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Excellent for image data; use data augmentation, dropout, and early stopping to prevent overfitting. 

**Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):** Suitable for sequence data; advanced techniques like LSTM/GRU and bidirectional RNNs can improve performance.
